# NFL Data Sources

The primary data source for NFL stats is the excellent [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse).
This is a freely available repo of historical NFL stats that gets updated regularly.

Optionally, you can also subscribe to the paid 
[Tank01 NFL Live Stats](https://rapidapi.com/tank01/api/tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl).
If you add a Tank01 API key to your environment, Sunday Slate will use it to update fantasy points while
the contest is running.

Nflverse does not publish stats until the conclusion of the game. Tank01 provides live stats. 
Not required for Sunday Slate, but useful on gameday. The app considers Nflverse the official stats however.
